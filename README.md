# Secure Kubernetes Deployment

This project demonstrates deploying secure and scalable Kubernetes clusters using **Helm**, **RBAC**, and **Istio**. It focuses on implementing security best practices, monitoring, and traffic management for containerized applications.

## Features
- **Secure Cluster Operations**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensures fine-grained permissions.
- **Standardized Deployments**: Helm charts simplify application deployment and management.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana provide observability into the cluster's performance.
- **Service Mesh**: Istio enhances traffic management, observability, and security for microservices.

## Technologies Used
